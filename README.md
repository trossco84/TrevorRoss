# Welcome to My Personal Repository

## About Me
As you can probably tell, my name is Trevor Ross. I was born and raised in South Florida (North Palm Beach) and attended the Univeristy of Florida. I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Industrial and Systems Engineering, with a minor in statistics. I am pursuing a Masters of Science in Quantitative Management from the Fuqua Business School at Duke University. I am currently working as a Strategy Consultant specializing in Data and AI in Chicago, IL. I enjoy most sports, whether it's playing or watching, and hanging out with my dog Boomer.
