# Welcome to My Personal Repository

## About Me
As you can probably tell, my name is Trevor Ross. I was born and raised in South Florida (North Palm Beach) and attended the Univeristy of Florida. I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Industrial and Systems Engineering, with a minor in statistics. I am currently working as a Decision Consultant (think: Solution Consultant + Data Science Consultant) in Chicago, IL. I enjoy most sports, whether it's playing or watching, and hanging out with my dog Boomer.

## Collections in this Repository
* Data Science and Machine Learning

  Language: Python
  
  This is a collection of projects worked on while I was a Teaching Assistant for a FinTech Bootcamp at Northwestern University and notes that I've taken throughout my Data Science Journey. A majority of these projects revolve around financial analysis and portfolio evaluation, or creating ML models from scratch (without libraries)
* Games

  This is a collection of games that I've created, give these a shot if you have some free time! I currently only have blackjack up and running, I will be adding more as I go.
* Ross Capital

  This is a collection of projects I've created to test different strategies in the stock market. Most of this just contains the data analysis/ideas I've had. If you'd like a look at my proprietary trading strategies (Algorithmic or Logic Based), please reach out.
* Side Quests

  This is a collection of projects where I explore the many capabilities of machine learning and test theories of my own. A lot of this is filled with loose files.
* Sports Science
  
  Sports is one of my hobbies and passions, this is a few of my attempts at predicting the outcomes of different sports/game styles. Will be adding more to this as I go.
